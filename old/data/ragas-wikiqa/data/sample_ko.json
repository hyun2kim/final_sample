      "African immigration to the United States refers to immigrants to the United States who are or were nationals of modern African countries. The term African in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national origins rather than racial affiliation. Between the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and 2017, Sub-Saharan African-born population in the United States grew to 2.1 million people.Sub-Saharan Africans in the United States come from almost all regions in Africa and do not constitute a homogeneous group. They include peoples from different national, linguistic, ethnic, racial, cultural and social backgrounds. As such, US and foreign born Sub-Saharan Africans are distinct from native-born African Americans, many of whose ancestors were involuntarily brought from West and Central Africa to the colonial United States by means of the historic Atlantic slave trade. African immigration is now driving the growth of the Black population in New York City.\n\n\n== Immigration legislation ==\n\n\n=== Citizenship ===\nIn the 1870s, the Naturalization Act was extended to allow \"aliens, being free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent\" to acquire citizenship. Immigration from Africa was theoretically permitted, unlike non-white immigration from Asia.\n\n\n=== Quotas enacted between 1921 and 1924 ===\nSeveral laws enforcing national origins quotas on U.S. immigration were enacted between 1921 and 1924 and were in effect until they were repealed in 1965. While the laws were aimed at restricting the immigration of Jews and Catholics from Southern and Eastern Europe and immigration from Asia, they also impacted African immigrants. The legislation effectively excluded Africans from entering the country.\nThe Emergency Quota Act of 1921 restricted immigration from a given country to 3% of the number of people from that country living in the U.S. according to the census of 1910. The Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the Johnson-Reed Act, reduced that to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the U.S. in 1890. Under the system, the quota for immigrants from Africa (excluding Egypt) totaled 1,100 (the number was increased to 1,400 under the 1952 McCarran–Walter Act.)  That contrasted to immigrants from Germany, which had a limit of 51,227.\n\n\n=== Repeal of quotas ===\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the Hart-Celler Act, repealed the national quotas and subsequently there was a substantial increase in the number of immigrants from developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. This act also provided a separate category for refugees. The act also provided greater opportunity for family reunification.\n\n\n=== Diversity Immigrant Visa ===\nThe Diversity Visa Program, or green card lottery, is a program created by the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows people born in countries with low rates of immigration to the United States to obtain a lawful permanent resident status. Each year, 50,000 of those visas are distributed at random. Almost 38% of those visas were attributed to African born immigrants in 2016. African born persons also represent the most numerous group among the applicants since 2013. The application is free of charge, and the requirements in terms of education are either a high school diploma or two years of a professional experience requiring at least two years of training.\n\n\n== Recent migration trends and factors ==\n\nThe continent of Africa has seen many changes in migrations patterns over the course of history. The graph below shows African immigration to the United States in 2016 based on class of admission with numbers from the Department of Homeland Security's Yearbook.\nThe influx of African immigrants began in the latter part of the 20th century and is often referred to as the \"fourth great migration.\" About three-fourths of all out-migration from Africa went to the United States after 1990.[7] This trend began after decolonization, as many Africans moved to the U.S. seeking an education and to escape poverty, and has risen steadily over time. The increase in the rate of migration is projected to continue for the coming decades.

      "many changes in migrations patterns over the course of history. The graph below shows African immigration to the United States in 2016 based on class of admission with numbers from the Department of Homeland Security's Yearbook.\nThe influx of African immigrants began in the latter part of the 20th century and is often referred to as the \"fourth great migration.\" About three-fourths of all out-migration from Africa went to the United States after 1990.[7] This trend began after decolonization, as many Africans moved to the U.S. seeking an education and to escape poverty, and has risen steadily over time. The increase in the rate of migration is projected to continue for the coming decades. Originally, these immigrants came with the sole purpose of advancing themselves before returning to their respective countries. Nevertheless, many immigrants never return. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of African immigrants interested in gaining permanent residence in the U.S.; this has led to a severe brain drain on the economies of African countries due to many skilled hard-working Africans leaving Africa to seek their economic fortunes in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nOne major factor that contributes to migration from Africa to the United States is labor opportunities. It has been relatively easier for African immigrants with advanced education to leave and enter international labor markets. In addition, many Africans move to the United States for advanced training. For example, doctors from different African nations would move to the U.S. in order to gain more economic opportunities compared to their home country.[14] However, as more Africans emigrate to the United States, their reasoning and factors tend to become more complex.[15]\nMany Africans who migrate to the United States return their income to Africa in the source of remittances. In Nigeria, for example, remittances from Nigerians in the United States to Nigeria totaled to $6.1 billion in 2012, approximately 3% of Nigeria's GDP. The important role of remittances in improving the lives of family members in the United States has led to both migration and migrants remaining in the United States.\nFollowing educational and economic trends of migration, family reunification has driven recent trends of migration. Family reunification refers to the ability of U.S. citizens to sponsor family members for immigration. Sponsoring immediate family members and other family preferences led to 45% and 10% of all African immigration in 2016 respectively. Legal service organizations such as the African Advocacy Network aid in family members sponsoring new immigrants to the United States.Additionally, refugees make up a large class of admission to the United States. Recent crises in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Burundi have been sources of migrants in recent years. With recent restrictions on refugee entrance to the United States, refugees may face a harder time entering the United States.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe total immigrant population from Africa estimated for 2015-2019 was 2,256,700. The top counties were:\n1) Harris County, TX ----------------------------- 70,200\n2) Los Angeles County, CA ------------------- 59,900\n3) Bronx Borough, NY --------------------------- 56,000\n4) Montgomery County, MD ----------------- 54,700\n5) Hennepin County, MN ---------------------- 53,700\n6) Prince George's County, MD ------------- 53,000\n7) Dallas County, TX ----------------------------- 46,700\n8) King County, WA ------------------------------- 42,500\n9) Cook County, IL -------------------------------- 42,100\n10) Franklin County, OH ----------------------- 41,400\n11) Fairfax County, VA -------------------------- 39,400\n12) Tarrant County, TX ------------------------- 34,900\n13) Brooklyn Borough, NY -------------------- 32,500\n14) Gwinnett County, GA ---------------------- 26,800\n15) Essex County, NJ --------------------------- 26,700\n16) Suffolk County, Mass. -------------------- 25,000\n17) Philadelphia County, PA ----------------- 25,000\n18) Queens Borough, NY ---------------------- 24,700\n19) DeKalb County, GA ------------------------- 24,500\n20) Maricopa County, AZ ---------------------"

      "Discount points, also called mortgage points or simply points, are a form of pre-paid interest available in the United States when arranging a mortgage. One point equals one percent of the loan amount. By charging a borrower points, a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate.  Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan, thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment. For each point purchased, the loan rate is typically reduced by anywhere from 1/8% (0.125%) to 1/4% (0.25%).Selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer. Accordingly, if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance, paying points will cost more than just paying the higher interest rate.Points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan.  Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate, thereby reducing the monthly loan payment.\nDiscount points may be different from origination fee, mortgage arrangement fee or broker fee. Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate. Origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.\nThe difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower. Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final good faith estimate (GFE).\nAlso directly related to points is the concept of the 'no closing cost loan', in which the consumer accepts a higher interest rate in return for the lender paying the loan's closing costs up front.  In some cases a purchaser can negotiate with the seller to get them to pay seller's points which can be used to pay mortgage points.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nirs.gov/publications/p936 – IRS Form 936 defines a point for the purpose of deducting mortgage interest for U.S. income taxes",

An official stated that the situation was \"grim\" and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back. Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27 million in compensation to settle the class-action suit. At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed. In June 2011, lending chief Dave Lowman was forced out over the scandal.On August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regime.

The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

      "Interlibrary loan (abbreviated ILL, and sometimes called document delivery, document supply, interlending, interlibrary services, interloan, or resource sharing) is a service that enables patrons of one library to borrow physical materials and receive electronic documents that are held by another library. The service expands library patrons' access to resources beyond their local library's holdings, serving as \"an integral element of collection development\" for libraries.\n\n\n== Procedures and methods ==\n\nAfter receiving a request from their patron, the borrowing library identifies potential lending libraries with the desired item. The lending library then delivers the item physically or electronically, and the borrowing library receives the item, delivers it to their patron, and if necessary, arranges for its return. In some cases, fees accompany interlibrary loan services. While the majority of interlibrary loan requests are now managed through semi-automated electronic systems, libraries can also submit requests by postal mail, fax, email, or telephone call, referred to as manual requests. Manual requests can be submitted in the United States through the American Library Association. \nInterlibrary loan and resource sharing have a variety of systems and workflows, which vary based on a library's scale of service, regional networks, and library management systems. Processes are automated by electronic systems, including VDX, Tipasa, ILLiad, Ex Libris Rapido, and OCLC Worldshare Management System.In the early 1990s, the Research Libraries Group released Ariel, a software that made communicating both photocopies and native digital articles more efficient. In the early 2000s, Atlas Systems, creators of ILLiad, launched Odyssey, which allowed for direct communication of digital files between libraries, and ultimately direct sending of digital materials to library patrons. OCLC created Article Exchange, a cloud-based article sharing platform that automatically deletes materials after a specified number of downloads and/or a number of days.With multiple interlibrary loan systems in use, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed ISO standards 10160 and 10161 to standardize terminology and define a set of communication protocols between various interlibrary loan systems, allowing for interoperability across platforms.Libraries can define what materials from their holdings are eligible for interlibrary loan. Many journal or database licenses specify whether a library can or cannot supply journal articles via ILL, with libraries negotiating for ILL eligibility. With increasing demand for digital materials, libraries have begun exploring the legal, technical, and licensing aspects of lending and borrowing ebooks through interlibrary loan.\n\n\n== History ==\nInformal borrowing and lending between libraries has a long history, with examples in Western Europe as early as the 8th century CE. In the 16th century, Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc unsuccessfully attempted to establish an interlibrary loan system between the Royal Library at the Louvre Palace in Paris and the Vatican Library in Rome.\n\nIn 1876, Massachusetts librarian Samuel Swett Green published a proposal for an interlibrary loan system modeled on European examples, writing, \"It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time.\"In 1886, Joseph C. Rowell, librarian at the University of California, Berkeley, sought permission to begin an interlibrary loan program. In 1894, Rowell initiated U.C. Berkeley's first program of interlibrary lending with the California State Library. In 1917, the American Library Association established a national code for interlibrary loan in the United States.In China, formalized interlibrary loan policies were established as early as 1924 through the Shanghai Library Constitution.In 1927, an increase in international lending and borrowing between libraries  following the First World War led to the establishment of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). IFLA would go on to publish the \"International Resource Sharing and Document Delivery: Principles and Guidelines for Procedure\" in 1954. These guidelines, which saw major revisions in 1978 and 2001, provided recommendations for countries to develop national policies for international resource sharing and document delivery",

The identification of a fiscal year is the calendar year in which it ends; thus, the current fiscal year is 2023, often written as \"FY2023\" or \"FY23\", which began on 1 October 2022 and will end on 30 September 2023.\nUntil 1976, the fiscal year began on 1 July and ended on 30 June. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 made the change to allow Congress more time to arrive at a budget each year, and provided for what is known as the \"transitional quarter\" from 1 July 1976 to 30 September 1976. An earlier shift in the federal government's fiscal year was made in 1843, shifting the fiscal year from a calendar year to one starting on 1 July.For example, the United States government Fiscal Year 2023 is:\n\n1st quarter: 1 October 2022 – 31 December 2022\n2nd quarter: 1 January 2023 – 31 March 2023\n3rd quarter: 1 April 2023 – 30 June 2023\n4th quarter: 1 July 2023 – 30 September 2023\n\n\n==== State governments ====\nState governments set their own fiscal year.

Four states have fiscal years that end on a different date:\n\nAlabama, ends 30 September\nMichigan, ends 30 September\nNew York, ends 31 March\nTexas, ends 31 AugustThe fiscal year for the Washington, D.C., government ends on 30 September.Among the inhabited territories of the United States, most align with the federal fiscal year, ending on 30 September. These include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico is the exception, with its fiscal year ending on 30 June.\n\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nIn Vietnam, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\n\n== Businesses and organizations ==\nThe tax year for a business is governed by the fiscal year it chooses.  A business may choose any consistent fiscal year that it wants; however, for seasonal businesses such as farming and retail, a good account practice is to end the fiscal year shortly after the highest revenue time of year.  Consequently, most large agriculture companies end their fiscal years after the harvest season, and most retailers end their fiscal years shortly after the Christmas shopping season.\n\n\n== See also ==\n4–4–5 calendar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"CIA world factbook - Fiscal Years 2080\".

Financial years are designated by the calendar year of the second half of the period. For example, financial year 2023 is the 12-month period ending on 30 June 2023 and can be referred to as FY2022/23. It is used for official purposes, by individual taxpayers and by the overwhelming majority of business enterprises. Business enterprises may opt to use a financial year that ends at the end of a week (e.g., 52 or 53 weeks in length, and therefore is not exactly one calendar year in length), or opt for its financial year to end on a date that matches the reporting cycle of its foreign parent. All entities within the one group must use the same financial year.\nFor government accounting and budget purposes, pre-Federation colonies changed the financial year from the calendar year to a year ending 30 June on the following dates: Victoria changed in 1870, South Australia in 1874, Queensland in 1875, Western Australia in 1892, New South Wales in 1895 and Tasmania in 1904. The Commonwealth adopted the near-ubiquitous financial year standard since its inception in 1901.

      "The sentence \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem \"Sacred Emily\", which appeared in the 1922 book Geography and Plays. In that poem, the first \"Rose\" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and the shortened form \"A rose is a rose is a rose\" is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning \"things are what they are\", a statement of the law of identity, \"A is A\". \nIn Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the rose as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, \"Now listen! I'm no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...' Yes, I'm no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years.\" (Four in America).She said to an audience at Oxford University that the statement referred to the fact that when the Romantics used the word \"rose\", it had a direct relationship to an actual rose. For later periods in literature this would no longer be true. The eras following Romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.\n\n\n== Mentions of \"rose\" in \"Sacred Emily\" ==\nThe following lines appear at widely separated places in \"Sacred Emily\":\n\nIt is rose in hen.\nJack Rose Jack Rose.\nRose is a rose is a rose is a rose.\n\n\n== Versions by others ==\n\"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.\" (\"Sacred Emily\", Geography and Plays)\n\"Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.\" (Operas and Plays)\n\"... she would carve on the tree Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose until it went all the way around.\" (The World is Round)\n\"A rose tree may be a rose tree may be a rosy rose tree if watered.\" (Alphabets and Birthdays)\n\"Indeed a rose is a rose makes a pretty plate....\" (Stanzas in Meditation)\n\"When I said.A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.\nAnd then later made that into a ring I made poetry and what did I do I caressed completely caressed and addressed a noun.\"  (Lectures in America)\"Civilization begins with a rose.

      "A notary public (a.k.a. notary or public notary; pl. notaries public) of the common law is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with general financial transactions, estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business. A notary's main functions are to validate the signature of a person (for purposes of signing a document); administer oaths and affirmations; take affidavits and statutory declarations, including from witnesses; authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents; take acknowledgments (e.g., of deeds and other conveyances); provide notice of foreign drafts; provide exemplifications and notarial copies; and, to perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction. Such transactions are known as notarial acts, or more commonly, notarizations. The term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries.With the exceptions of Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Quebec (whose private law is based on civil law), and British Columbia (whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice), a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries. Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinctly different from the practice of law, and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States. Despite these distinctions, lawyers in the United States may apply to become notaries, and this class of notary is allowed to provide legal advice, such as determining the type of act required (affidavit, acknowledgment, etc.).\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNotaries are appointed by a government authority, such as a court, governor, county commissioners, or lieutenant governor, or by a regulating body often known as a society or faculty of notaries public. For lawyer notaries, an appointment may be for life, while lay notaries are usually commissioned for a briefer term (often 3 to 5 years in the U.S.), with the possibility of renewal.\nIn most common law countries, appointments and their number for a given notarial district are highly regulated. However, since the majority of American notaries are lay persons who provide officially required services, commission numbers are not regulated, which is part of the reason why there are far more notaries in the United States than in other countries (4.5 million vs. approx. 740 in England and Wales and approx. 1,250 in Australia and New Zealand). Furthermore, all U.S. and some Canadian notarial functions are applied to domestic affairs and documents, where fully systematized attestations of signatures and acknowledgment of deeds are a universal requirement for document authentication. In the U.S., notaries public do not authenticate documents in a traditional sense: instead, they authenticate that the signature(s) on a document belongs to the person(s) claiming to be the signer(s), thus ensuring trust among interested parties. By contrast, outside North American common law jurisdictions, notarial practice is restricted to international legal matters or where a foreign jurisdiction is involved, and almost all notaries are also qualified lawyers.\nFor the purposes of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized before they can be used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a notarial certificate–a separate document stating the notarial act performed and upon which the party(ies) and notary sign–which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an appearer or constituent (U.S.). In the U.S., many documents include the notarial wording within the document, thus eliminating the need for an additional page for the certificate only (i.e., the document is signed and notarized,",

Both the latter two categories are required to pass examinations set by the Master of Faculties.\nThe regulation of notaries was modernised by section 57 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.\nNotarial services generally include: \n\nattesting the signature and execution of documents\nauthenticating the execution of documents\nauthenticating the contents of documents\nadministration of oaths and declarations\ndrawing up or noting (and extending) protests of happenings to ships, crews and cargoes\npresenting bills of exchange for acceptance and payment, noting and protesting bills in cases of dishonour and preparing acts of honour\nattending upon the drawing up of bonds\ndrawing mercantile documents, deeds, sales or purchases of property, and wills in English and (via translation), in foreign languages for use in Britain, the Commonwealth and other foreign countries\nproviding documents to deal with the administration of the estate of people who are abroad, or own property abroad\nauthenticating personal documents and information for immigration or emigration purposes, or to apply to marry, divorce, adopt children or to work abroad\nverification of translations from foreign languages to English and vice versa\ntaking evidence in England and Wales as a commissioner for oaths for foreign courts\nprovision of notarial copies\npreparing and witnessing powers of attorney, corporate records, contracts for use in Britain or overseas\nauthenticating company and business documents and transactions\ninternational Internet domain name transfers\n\n\n==== Scotland ====\nNotaries public have existed in Scotland since the 13th century and developed as a distinct element of the Scottish legal profession.  Those who wish to practice as a notary must petition the Court of Session.  This petition is usually presented at the same time as a petition to practice as a solicitor, but can sometimes be earlier or later.  However, to qualify, a notary must hold a current Practising Certificate from the Law Society of Scotland, a new requirement from 2007, before which all Scottish solicitors were automatically notaries.\nWhilst notaries in Scotland are always solicitors, the profession remains separate in that there are additional rules and regulations governing notaries and it is possible to be a solicitor, but not a notary.  Since 2007 an additional Practising Certificate is required, so now most, but not all, solicitors in Scotland are notaries – a significant difference from the English profession.  They are also separate from notaries in other jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.The profession is administered by the Council of the Law Society of Scotland under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990.\nIn Scotland, the duties and services provided by the notary are similar to England and Wales, although they are needed for some declarations in divorce matters for which they are not in England.  Their role declined following the Law Agents (Scotland) Amendment Act 1896 which stipulated only enrolled law agents could become notaries and the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 which extended notarial execution to law agents.  The primary functions of a Scottish notary are:\n\noaths, affidavits, and affirmations\naffidavits in undefended divorces and for matrimonial homes\nmaritime protests\nexecution or certification for foreign jurisdictions, e.g., estates, court actions, powers of attorney, etc.\nnotarial execution for the blind or illiterate\nentry of a person to overseas territories\ncompletion of the documentation required for the registration of a company in certain foreign jurisdictions; and\ndrawing for repayment of Bonds of Debenture\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n== Civil law jurisdictions ==\n\nThe role of notaries in civil law countries is much greater than in common law countries.

      "MacConkey agar is a selective and differential culture medium for bacteria. It is designed to selectively isolate Gram-negative and enteric (normally found in the intestinal tract) bacteria and differentiate them based on lactose fermentation. Lactose fermenters turn red or pink on MacConkey agar, and nonfermenters do not change color. The media inhibits growth of Gram-positive organisms with crystal violet and bile salts, allowing for the selection and isolation of gram-negative bacteria. The media detects lactose fermentation by enteric bacteria with the pH indicator neutral red.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nIt contains bile salts (to inhibit most Gram-positive bacteria), crystal violet dye (which also inhibits certain Gram-positive bacteria), and neutral red dye (which turns pink if the microbes are fermenting lactose).\nComposition:\nPeptone – 17 g\nProteose peptone – 3 g\nLactose – 10 g\nBile salts – 1.5 g\nSodium chloride – 5 g\nNeutral red – 0.03 g\nCrystal violet – 0.001 g\nAgar – 13.5 g\nWater – add to make 1 litre; adjust pH to 7.1 +/− 0.2\nSodium taurocholateThere are many variations of MacConkey agar depending on the need. If the spreading or swarming of Proteus species is not required, sodium chloride is omitted. Crystal violet at a concentration of 0.0001% (0.001 g per litre) is included when needing to check if Gram-positive bacteria are inhibited. MacConkey with sorbitol is used to isolate E. coli O157, an enteric pathogen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe medium was developed by Alfred Theodore MacConkey while working as a bacteriologist for the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nUsing neutral red pH indicator, the agar distinguishes those Gram-negative bacteria that can ferment the sugar lactose (Lac+) from those that cannot (Lac-).\nThis medium is also known as an \"indicator medium\" and a \"low selective medium\". Presence of bile salts inhibits swarming by Proteus species.\n\n\n=== Lac positive ===\nBy utilizing the lactose available in the medium, Lac+ bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Klebsiella will produce acid, which lowers the pH of the agar below 6.8 and results in the appearance of pink colonies.  The bile salts precipitate in the immediate neighborhood of the colony, causing the medium surrounding the colony to become hazy.\n\n\n=== Lac negative ===\nOrganisms unable to ferment lactose will form normal-colored (i.e., un-dyed) colonies. The medium will remain yellow. Examples of non-lactose fermenting bacteria are Salmonella, Proteus species, Yersinia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella.\n\n\n=== Slow ===\nSome organisms ferment lactose slowly or weakly, and are sometimes put in their own category. These include Serratia and Citrobacter.\n\n\n=== Mucoid colonies ===\nSome organisms, especially Klebsiella and Enterobacter, produce mucoid colonies which appear very moist and sticky and slimy. This phenomenon happens because the organism is producing a capsule, which is predominantly made from the lactose sugar in the agar.\n\n\n== Variant ==\nA variant, sorbitol-MacConkey agar, (with the addition of additional selective agents) can assist in the isolation and differentiation of enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype E. coli O157:H7, by the presence of colorless circular colonies that are non-sorbitol fermenting.\n\n\n== See also ==\nR2a agar\nMRS agar (culture medium designed to grow Gram-positive bacteria and differentiate them for lactose fermentation).\n\n\n== References ==",

Significant differences were observed for all investigated clinical parameters of periodontitis in favor of the scaling and root planing + SDD group where SDD dosage regimens is 20 mg twice daily for three months in a meta-analysis published in 2011.\n\n\n== Contraindications ==\n\n\n=== Pregnancy and lactation ===\nDoxycycline is categorized by the FDA as a class D drug in pregnancy. Doxycycline crosses into breastmilk. Other tetracycline antibiotics are contraindicated in pregnancy and up to eight years of age, due to the potential for disrupting bone and tooth development. They include a class warning about staining of teeth and decreased development of dental enamel in children exposed to tetracyclines in utero, during breastfeeding or during young childhood. However, the FDA has acknowledged that the actual risk of dental staining of primary teeth is undetermined for doxycycline specifically. The best available evidence indicates that doxycycline has little or no effect on hypoplasia of dental enamel or on staining of teeth and the CDC recommends the use of doxycycline for treatment of Q fever and also for tick-borne rickettsial diseases in young children and others advocate for its use in malaria.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nOther contraindications are severe liver disease and concomitant use of isotretinoin or other retinoids, as both tetracyclines and retinoids can cause intracranial hypertension (increased pressure around the brain) in rare cases.\n\n\n==== Adverse effects ====\nAdverse effects are similar to those of other members of the tetracycline antibiotic group. Doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal upset. Oral doxycycline can cause pill esophagitis, particularly when it is swallowed without adequate fluid, or by persons with difficulty swallowing or impaired mobility. Doxycycline is less likely than other antibiotic drugs to cause Clostridium difficile colitis.\nAn erythematous rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.Unlike some other members of the tetracycline group, it may be used in those with renal impairment.Doxycycline use has been associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In one large retrospective study, patients who were prescribed doxycycline for their acne had a 2.25-fold greater risk of developing Crohn's disease.\n\n\n== Interactions ==\nThe combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness.\nBreakfast was observed to reduce doxycycline absorption significantly. Absorption of tetracycline occurs in the stomach and the upper small intestine. Absorption of tetracyclines has been reported to be impaired by milk products, aluminum hydroxide gels, sodium"

Later, Sera explains to her therapist that she accepted Ben for who he was and loved him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nMike Figgis based Leaving Las Vegas on a 1990 autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, who died of suicide in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being used as the basis for a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment with the novel, stating \"Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I did Mr. Jones, because I think manic-depression is a fascinating, sad, and amazing phenomenon. It's not a coincidence that some of the greatest artists have been manic-depressives. That made it, to me, a fascinating subject that, alas, did not come out in the film.\"\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nFiggis encouraged the lead actors to experience their characters' ordeals first-hand by extensive research. He told Film Critic: \"It was just a week and a half of rehearsal. A lot of conversations. A lot of communication in the year before we made the film. Reading the book. I encouraged them [Cage and Shue] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three of us got together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, about anything that came up.\" Cage researched by binge drinking in Dublin for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He also visited hospitalized career alcoholics. He said \"it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part.\" Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe limited budget dictated the production and Figgis ended up filming in super 16mm and composing his own score. He said \"We didn't have any money, and we weren't pretending to be something we weren't. We couldn't shut down The Strip to shoot\". Cage recounted that he found the use of 16mm liberating as an actor stating in a 1995 interview with Roger Ebert:  \"As an actor, having a 16-mm. camera in my face was liberating because it's much smaller, so you don't feel as intimidated by it. It catches those little nuances. Because as soon as that big camera's in your face, you tense up a little bit. Film acting is a learning experience about how to get over that, but I don't know that you ever really do.\"\nFiggis had problems because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This caused him to film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and the authenticity of the acting, remarking \"I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout.' And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel really stupid, because it's unnatural. You put them up against a couple of trucks, with it all happening around them, and their voices become great\". Filming took place over 28 days.\n\n\n== Release ==\nLeaving Las Vegas had a limited release on October 27, 1995. As it won awards from multiple film critics’ organizations and earned four Academy Award nominations, the film's release was expanded and it ultimately opened nationwide on February 9, 1996. United Artists distributed the film in North America, while RCV Film Distribution and Atalanta Filmes handled the European release, and 21st Century Film Corporation distributed the film in Australia.

      "Leaving Las Vegas is a 1995 American drama film written and directed by Mike Figgis and based on the semi-autobiographical 1990 novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic in Los Angeles who, having lost his family and been recently fired, has decided to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. He loads a supply of liquor and beer into his BMW and gets drunk as he drives from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Once there, he develops a romantic relationship with a sex worker played by Elisabeth Shue and the film shifts to include her narrative perspective. O'Brien died from suicide after signing away the film rights to the novel.Leaving Las Vegas was filmed in super 16 mm instead of 35 mm film; while 16 mm was common for art house films at the time, 35 mm is most commonly used for mainstream film. After limited release in the United States on October 27, 1995, Leaving Las Vegas was released nationwide on February 9, 1996, receiving strong praise from critics and audiences. Cage received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor, while Shue was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actress. The film also received nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nBen Sanderson is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who has lost his job, family, and friends. With nothing left to live for, and a sizable severance check from his boss, he heads to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One early morning, he drives drunkenly from his Los Angeles home down to the Las Vegas Strip; he nearly hits a woman, Sera, on the crosswalk. She chastises him and walks away.\nSera is a prostitute working for abusive Latvian pimp Yuri Butsov. Polish mobsters are after Yuri, so he ends his relationship with Sera in fear that the Poles may hurt her. On his second day in Las Vegas, Ben looks for Sera, introduces himself, and offers her $500 to come to his room for an hour. Sera agrees, but Ben does not want sex. Instead, they talk and develop a rapport; Sera invites Ben to move into her apartment. Ben instructs Sera never to ask him to stop drinking. Ben says he will not criticize her occupation and she thanks him.\nAt first, the pair are happy but soon become frustrated with the other's behavior. Sera begs Ben to see a doctor, which he refuses to do. While Sera is working, Ben goes to a casino and returns with another prostitute. Sera returns to find them in her bed and throws Ben out. Shortly afterward, Sera is approached by three college students at the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. She initially rejects their offer by stating that she only \"dates\" one at a time but eventually acquiesces when she is offered an increased price. When she enters their hotel room, the students change the deal and demand anal sex, which she refuses. When she attempts to leave, they violently gang-rape her.\nThe following day, Sera is spotted by her landlady returning home bruised and is evicted. Sera receives a call from Ben, who is on his deathbed. Sera visits Ben, the two make love, and he dies shortly thereafter. Later, Sera explains to her therapist that she accepted Ben for who he was and loved him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nMike Figgis based Leaving Las Vegas on a 1990 autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, who died of suicide in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being used as the basis for a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment with the novel, stating \"Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I did Mr. Jones, because I think manic-depression is a"

      "A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is a device that measures the geometry of physical objects by sensing discrete points on the surface of the object with a probe. Various types of probes are used in CMMs, the most common being mechanical and laser sensors, though optical and white light sensor do exist. Depending on the machine, the probe position may be manually controlled by an operator or it may be computer controlled. CMMs typically specify a probe's position in terms of its displacement from a reference position in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (i.e., with XYZ axes). In addition to moving the probe along the X, Y, and Z axes, many machines also allow the probe angle to be controlled to allow measurement of surfaces that would otherwise be unreachable.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe typical 3D \"bridge\" CMM allows probe movement along three axes, X, Y and Z, which are orthogonal to each other in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Each axis has a sensor that monitors the position of the probe on that axis, with typical accuracy in the order of microns. When the probe contacts (or otherwise detects) a particular location on the object, the machine samples the axis position sensors, thus measuring the location of one point on the object's surface, as well as the 3-dimensional vector of the measurement taken. This process is repeated as necessary, moving the probe each time, to produce a \"point cloud\" which describes the surface areas of interest. The points can be measured either manually by an operator or automatically via Direct Computer Control (DCC) or automatically using scripted programs; thus, an automated CMM is a specialized form of industrial robot.\nA common use of CMMs is in manufacturing and assembly processes to test a part or assembly against the design intent. The measured points can be used to verify the distance between features. They can also be used to construct geometric features such as cylinders and planes etc. for GD&T such as roundness, flatness and perpendicularity can be assessed. \n\n\n== Technical facts ==\n\n\n=== Parts ===\nCoordinate-measuring machines include three main components:\n\nThe main structure includes three axes of motion. The material used to construct the moving frame has varied over the years. Granite and steel were used in the early CMM's. Today all the major CMM manufacturers build frames from Granite, aluminum alloy or some derivative and also use ceramic to increase the stiffness of the Z axis for scanning applications. Few CMM builders today still manufacture granite frame CMM due to market requirement for improved metrology dynamics and increasing trend to install CMM outside of the quality lab. The increasing trend towards scanning also requires the CMM Z axis to be stiffer and new materials have been introduced such as black granite, ceramic and silicon carbide.\nProbing system\nData collection and reduction system — typically includes a machine controller, desktop computer and application software.\n\n\n=== Availability ===\nThese machines are available as stationary or portable.\n\n\n=== Accuracy ===\nThe accuracy of coordinate measurement machines are typically given as an uncertainty factor as a function over distance. For a CMM using a touch probe, this relates to the repeatability of the probe and the accuracy of the linear scales. Typical probe repeatability can result in measurements of within .001mm or .00005 inch (half a ten thousandth) over the entire measurement volume. For 3, 3+2, and 5 axis machines, probes are routinely calibrated using traceable standards and the machine movement is verified using gauges to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n== Specific parts ==\n\n\n=== Machine body ===\nThe first CMM was developed by the Ferranti Company of Scotland in the 1950s as the result of a direct need to measure precision components in their military products, although this machine only had 2 axes.  The first 3-axis models began appearing in the 1960s (DEA of Italy / LK of the UK) and computer control debuted in the early 1970s but the first working CMM was developed and put on sale by Browne & Sharpe in Melbourne, England. (Leitz Germany subsequently produced a fixed machine structure with moving",
      "Multisensor-measuring machines ==\nTraditional CMM technology using touch probes is today often combined with other  measurement technology. This includes laser, video or white light sensors to provide what is known as multisensor measurement.\n\n\n== Standardization ==\nTo verify the performance of a coordinate measurement machine, the ISO 10360 series is available. This series of standards define the characteristics of the probing system and the length measurement error:\n\nPForm: probing deviation when measuring the form of a sphere\nPSize: probing deviation when measuring the size of a sphere\nEUni: deviation of measuring length on spheres from one direction\nEBi: deviation of measuring length on spheres from left and rightThe ISO 10360 series consists of the following parts:\n\nISO 10360-1 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 1: Vocabulary\nISO 10360-2 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 2: CMMs used for measuring linear dimensions\nISO 10360-7 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 7: CMMs equipped with imaging probing systems\nISO 10360-8 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring systems (CMS) -- Part 8: CMMs with optical distance sensors\n\n\n== See also ==\nUniversal measuring machine\n3D scanner\n\n\n== References =="

      "In physiology, body water is the water content of an animal body that is contained in the tissues, the blood, the bones and elsewhere. The percentages of body water contained in various fluid compartments add up to total body water (TBW). This water makes up a significant fraction of the human body, both by weight and by volume. Ensuring the right amount of body water is part of fluid balance, an aspect of homeostasis.\n\n\n== Location ==\nBy weight, the average adult human is approximately 60% water, and the average child is approximately 70% water. There can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age, health, water intake, weight, and sex. In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes, the adult human body averaged ~65% water. However, this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in body composition). The figure for water fraction by weight in this sample was found to be 58 ±8% water for males and 48 ±6% for females. The body water constitutes as much as 75% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight. This is due to how fat tissue does not retain water as well as lean tissue. These statistical averages will vary with factors such as type of population, age of people sampled, number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure.\nMost animal body water is contained in various body fluids. These include intracellular fluid; extracellular fluid; plasma; interstitial fluid; and transcellular fluid.  Water is also contained inside organs, in gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids.  Adipose tissue contains about 10% of water, while muscle tissue contains about 75%.In Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology (2002), body water is broken down into the following compartments:\nIntracellular fluid (2/3 of body water) is fluid contained within cells. In a 72 kg (159 lb) body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5%. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular.\nExtracellular fluid (1/3 of body water) is fluid contained in areas outside of cells. For a 40-litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5%.\nPlasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid). Of this 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres, or 20%.\nInterstitial fluid (4/5 of extracellular fluid)\nTranscellular fluid (a.k.a. \"third space,\" normally ignored in calculations) contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids.\n\n\n== Measurement ==\n\n\n=== Dilution and equilibration ===\nAn individual’s total body water can be determined using flowing-afterglow mass spectrometry (FA-MS) to measure the abundance of deuterium in breath samples.  A known dose of deuterated water (heavy water, D2O) is ingested and allowed to equilibrate within the body water. Then, the FA-MS instrument measures the ratio D:H of deuterium to hydrogen in the water vapour in exhaled breath.  The total body water is then accurately measured from the increase in breath deuterium content in relation to the volume of D2O ingested.\nThe water in individual compartments can be measured with different substances:\ntotal body water: tritiated water or heavy water.\nextracellular fluid: inulin\nblood plasma: Evans blueIntracellular fluid may then be estimated by subtracting extracellular fluid from total body water.\n\n\n=== Bioelectrical impedance analysis ===\nAnother method of determining total body water percentage (TBW%) is via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

In the traditional BIA method, a person lies on a cot and spot electrodes are placed on the hands and bare feet. Electrolyte gel is applied first, and then a weak current of frequency 50kHz is introduced. This AC waveform allows the creation of a current inside the body via the very capacitive skin without causing a DC flow or burns, and limited in the ~20mA range current for safety.BIA has emerged as a promising technique because of its simplicity, low cost, high reproducibility, and noninvasiveness. BIA prediction equations can be either generalized or population-specific, allowing this method to be potentially very accurate. Selecting the appropriate equation is important to determining the quality of the results.For clinical purposes, scientists are developing a multi-frequency BIA method that may further improve the method's ability to predict a person's hydration level. New segmental BIA equipment that uses more electrodes may lead to more precise measurements of specific parts of the body.\n\n\n== Calculation ==\nIn humans, total body water can be estimated based on the premorbid (or ideal) body weight and correction factor.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        B\n        W\n        =\n        w\n        e\n        i\n        g\n        h\n        t\n        ∗\n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle TBW=weight*C}\n  C is a coefficient for the expected percentage of weight made up of free water. For adult, non-elderly males, C = 0.6. For adult elderly males, malnourished males, or females, C = 0.5. For adult elderly or malnourished females, C = 0.45. A total body water deficit (TBWD) can then be approximated by the following formula:\n\nWhere [Na]t = target sodium concentration (usually 140 mEq/L), and [Na]m = measured sodium concentration.\nThe resultant value is the approximate volume of free water required to correct a hypernatremic state. In practice, the value rarely approximates the actual amount of free water required to correct a deficit due to insensible losses, urinary output, and differences in water distribution among patients. \n\n\n== Functions ==\nWater in the animal body performs a number of functions: as a solvent for transportation of nutrients; as a medium for excretion; a means for heat control; as a lubricant for joints; and for shock absorption.\n\n\n== Changes ==\nThe usual way of adding water to a body is by drinking.  Water also enters the body with foods, especially those rich in water, such as plants, raw meat, and fish. About 10% of human adult water intake comes as a by-product of metabolism.The amount of this water that is retained in animals is affected by several factors. Water amounts vary with the age of the animal. The older the vertebrate animal, the higher its relative bone mass and the lower its body water content.\nIn diseased states, where body water is affected, the fluid compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem, or"
